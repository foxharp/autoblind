pin restrictions:

    IR_IN needs to be on an input capture pin:  PA4 on attiny861

    SUART_RX serial needs to be on INT0:  PB6 on attiny861
    SUART_TX serial needs to be on OC1A:  PB1 on attiny861

    MOTOR_TURN needs to be on INT1:  PA2 on attiny861

    bootloader uses PA2?

    PB0, PB1, PB2, and PB7 (reset) are used during programming.
    PB2 is connected XOstick button, and we use it for debug mode
    PB0 and PB1 are the LEDs
    PB3 and PB4 are used for USB

    that leaves PB3, PB4, PB5, PA0, PA1, PA3 - PA7

pin choices:
    MOTOR_ON	PA0
    MOTOR_DIR	PA1
    MOTOR_TURN  PA2

    LIMIT	PA3

    IR_IN	PA4

    PDEBUG	PB2

    SUART_RX	PB6
    SUART_TX	PB1

moving initialized data (incl. strings) to program memory


i know this topic is well covered in the avr-libc docs, but i've come up with a technique that i haven't seen written up before, and thought i'd share it -- in case someone else finds it useful, in case it's already documented and i missed it, and in case there's a huge downside i haven't yet considered.

to start:  i don't think i've ever worked on an embedded system (on the scale of an 8-bit micro) where i needed my initialized data to be in RAM.  having it read-only, and stored with the code, is just fine.  yes, it breaks C semantics, and in the AVR world requires special accessors (i.e., pgm_read_xxxx()), but the RAM space savings is always worth it.

so:  i took a copy of avr25.x, the default avr-ld linker script for my attiny861, and changed a single line.  at the point where the .data sections are "redirected" into data memory, those sections are simply put into text memory, instead:
[code]
  .data   : AT (ADDR (.text) + SIZEOF (.text))
  {
     PROVIDE (__data_start = .) ;
    *(.data)
    *(.data*)
    *(.rodata)  /* We need to include .rodata here if gcc is used */
    *(.rodata*) /* with -fdata-sections.  */
    *(.gnu.linkonce.d*)
    . = ALIGN(2);
     _edata = . ;
     PROVIDE (__data_end = .) ;
/*
 * "} > data" replaced, in order to move data to flash */
 */
  }  > text
[/code]

this has the effect of giving __data_start and __data_load_start both the same address value, pointing into codespace.  since this would in turn break the behavior of __do_copy_data (the routine in crt0 that moves the initial copy of initialized data from flash to RAM), i added the following to main.c:
[code]
// override default __do_copy_data(), since we build with
// a linker script that leaves data in flash.
void __do_copy_data(void) { }
[/code]

and that's it.  all double-quoted strings are now in code space, with no further __attribute__ magic needed.  other initialized data moves as well.  (i never have much of that, so that's not as big a deal for me.)  all such data needs to be accessed via pgm_read_xxxx() routines, but that's a good trade against having two copies of every string (one in flash, one in RAM).

i'm pleased with this solution.  i like taking advantage of the fairly generous flash on modern chips to include sufficient of debugging text, but jumping through hoops to keep those strings out of RAM was frustrating.

can anyone see a big downside?  is there code in the libraries that depends on RAM-based initialized data?  i'm going to add a Makefile check to detect such instances, just in case -- something based along the lines of:
[code]
grep -v 'D _edata' myprog.map  | grep ' [dD] '
[/code]
which basically checks for named objects in the data section.

comments welcome.
